Installation Instructions:
-------------

See documentation at [http://xknx.io/home_assistant](http://xknx.io/home_assistant)

Syncing with Upstream:
-------------

Use the `sync_upstream.pl` script to update the KNX component to the latest HA version.
It will copy all the files from your HA installation into the local XKNX repository.

Please make sure you read the instructions in the `sync_upstream.pl` script first before
you do this as it will override all changes in the XKNX repository with those from HA.
